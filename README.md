# SlowBuild-Game
A place to slowly build a game in Unity

A more wonderful way of version controlling than the silly Collab system in Unity (do not recommend).

My dreams for the game, as of 10/28/21
- You're a robot that improves the world
- Entropy-Reversal: the joy of cleaning up and leaving the world a tidier place
- Chore simulation: vacuuming, trash/sorting, digging-out
- Community Building: Building a bot town, all working together to make a greater community
- Trash Mountain: the main goal, to remove trash, discover secrets, and build
- Trash as a resource: building material!
- Gems as a resource: desired by mysterious cloaked figures in exchange for hi-tech upgrades
